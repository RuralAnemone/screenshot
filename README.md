# screenshot
a bookmarklet to screenshot any page

## how to use:
1. drag the following code into your bookmarks bar:

```js
javascript:(function(){script = document.createElement("script");script.src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RuralAnemone/screenshot/script.js";document.body.appendChild(script)}())
```

click it and follow the prompts to screenshot any page!

(this is especially (and probably *only*) useful if for some reason your school has blocked screenshots)
